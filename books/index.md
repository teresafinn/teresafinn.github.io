>“When I think back on my life, I can define a set of books that shaped me — intellectually, emotionally... Books have always been an escape, a learning experience, a saviour, but beyond this, greater than this, certain books became, over time, a kind of glue that holds together my understanding of the world. I think of them as nodes of knowledge and emotion, nodes that knot together the fabric my self. Books, for me anyway, hold together who I am.” - Hugh McGuire, [**"Why We Can't Read Anymore"**](https://medium.com/@hughmcguire/why-can-t-we-read-anymore-503c38c131fe)

## Smattering of Fun Phrases
I jot down turns of phrase that catch my fancy (when I remember). These are some of them. One of these days I'm going to build a random quote generator to embed in this section. I'll populate the database with these quotes and more so I can dust them off every once in a while:)

<img style="float: left; padding-right: 50px" src="/images/books-to-set-you-free.jpg" alt="Znaniye razorvet tsepi rabstva [Knowledge will break the chains of slavery], a poster by Alexei Radakov (1872-1942).">

* <em>"In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes on." </em> (Robert Frost  quoted in The Harper Book of Quotations)
* <em>"Once a thing is known it can never be unknown. It can only be forgotten. And, in a way that bends time, so long as it is remembered, it will indicate the future. It is wiser, in every circumstance, to forget, to cultivate the art of forgetting. To remember is to face the enemy. The truth lies in remembering." </em> (from Look at Me by Anita Brookner)
* <em>"The pitcher longs for water to carry and a person for work that is real"</em> (from Marge Piercy’s poem “To Be of Use”)
* <em>"Unlike ordinary topiary they moved: they lumbered along very slowly, almost imperceptibly, wading half submerged in the dark foliage like hippopotami wallowing in an equatorial African river."</em> (from The Magicians)
* <em>"...dragged back down the gravity well of the ordinary world"</em> (from The Magicians)
* <em>"blooms in spite of all horticultural logic"</em> (from The Magicians)
* <em>"a puzzle smarter than you"</em>
* <em>"Her indifference was impenetrable"</em> (from Olive Kitteridge)
* <em>"wears outrage like another man's suit"</em>
* <em>"When civilized people dance they reconnect with their old animal nature. It reminds them that they aren’t mechanical chess pieces or rooted trees, but free-flowing meat waves of possibility"</em> (from B is for Beer)
* <em>"If you have some liniment, I’ll put it on my dignity."</em> (from A Wrinkle in Time)
* <em>"The life I should be living had been mislaid through some clerical error in the cosmic bureaucracy"</em> (from The Magicians)
* <em>"All of them had gone through security with the complacency of cows; Olive seeming the only one with trepidation"</em> (from Olive Kitteridge)
* <em>"...large amounts of insecurity can take the form of stupidity"</em> (from Olive Kitteridge)
* <em>"a stunned block of perfect oddness"</em> (from Olive Kitteridge)
