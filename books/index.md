>“When I think back on my life, I can define a set of books that shaped me — intellectually, emotionally... Books have always been an escape, a learning experience, a saviour, but beyond this, greater than this, certain books became, over time, a kind of glue that holds together my understanding of the world. I think of them as nodes of knowledge and emotion, nodes that knot together the fabric my self. Books, for me anyway, hold together who I am.” - Hugh McGuire, [**"Why We Can't Read Anymore"**](https://medium.com/@hughmcguire/why-can-t-we-read-anymore-503c38c131fe)

## Smattering of Fun Phrases
I jot down turns of phrase that catch my fancy (when I remember). These are some of them. One of these days I'm going to build a random quote generator to embed in this section. I'll populate the database with these quotes and more so I can dust them off every once in a while:)

<img style="float: left; padding-right: 50px" src="/images/books-to-set-you-free.jpg" alt="Znaniye razorvet tsepi rabstva [Knowledge will break the chains of slavery], a poster by Alexei Radakov (1872-1942).">

* <em>"The pitcher longs for water to carry and a person for work that is real"</em> (from Marge Piercy’s poem “To Be of Use”)
* <em>"Unlike ordinary topiary they moved: they lumbered along very slowly, almost imperceptibly, wading half submerged in the dark foliage like hippopotami wallowing in an equatorial African river."</em> (from The Magicians)
* <em>"...dragged back down the gravity well of the ordinary world"</em> (from The Magicians)
* <em>"blooms in spite of all horticultural logic"</em> (from The Magicians)
* <em>"a puzzle smarter than you"</em>
* <em>"Her indifference was impenetrable"</em> (from Olive Kitteridge)
* <em>"wears outrage like another man's suit"</em>
* <em>"When civilized people dance they reconnect with their old animal nature. It reminds them that they aren’t mechanical chess pieces or rooted trees, but free-flowing meat waves of possibility"</em> (from B is for Beer)
* <em>"If you have some liniment, I’ll put it on my dignity."</em> (from A Wrinkle in Time)
* <em>"The life I should be living had been mislaid through some clerical error in the cosmic bureaucracy"</em> (from The Magicians)
* <em>"All of them had gone through security with the complacency of cows; Olive seeming the only one with trepidation"</em> (from Olive Kitteridge)
* <em>"...large amounts of insecurity can take the form of stupidity"</em> (from Olive Kitteridge)
* <em>"a stunned block of perfect oddness"</em> (from Olive Kitteridge)
