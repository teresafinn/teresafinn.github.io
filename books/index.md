>“When I think back on my life, I can define a set of books that shaped me — intellectually, emotionally... Books have always been an escape, a learning experience, a saviour, but beyond this, greater than this, certain books became, over time, a kind of glue that holds together my understanding of the world. I think of them as nodes of knowledge and emotion, nodes that knot together the fabric my self. Books, for me anyway, hold together who I am.” - Hugh McGuire, [**"Why We Can't Read Anymore"**](https://medium.com/@hughmcguire/why-can-t-we-read-anymore-503c38c131fe)

## Smattering of Fun Phrases
I jot down turns of phrase that catch my fancy (when I remember). These are some of them. One of these days I'm going to build a random quote generator to embed in this section. I'll populate the database with these quotes and more so they can be savored like hard candy. :)
