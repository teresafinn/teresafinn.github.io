### Thank you for your patience! I'm in the process of migrating my blog posts from a former location - full post to come soon!

<!-- Have you listened to Ruby5? It’s pretty amazing! I love it because it’s not a huge time commitment - I can hop on and get a digest version of what’s happening in the Ruby community - much of which I don’t yet understand - and then read more about the things I find useful at my leisure. Recently they had reported a Ruby’s version 2.2.2 debut which was intended to fix Ruby’s SSL security flaws. Now I had no idea what exactly this meant so I decided to go on an adventure to figure it out. For the newbies to the community, let’s break this down! -->
