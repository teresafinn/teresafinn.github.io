## Techy Projects
* **The Diaper Doppler** -
<!-- (http://diaper-doppler.herokuapp.com) -->
<!-- [(https://github.com/teresafinn/the-dirty-cookie)](https://github.com/teresafinn/the-dirty-cookie) -->
I'm really excited to currently be developing a web app for the non-profit [**PDX Diaper Bank**](www.pdxdiaperbank.org/). I'm working on creating an application that will allow volunteers at the diaper bank to place a bag of diapers on a scale and get an automatic read-out of how many diapers the package contains. This will help volunteers not have to count one-by-one all the thousands of diapers that are donated, and will ideally help distribution go much quicker!

* [**The Dirty Cookie**](http://dirty-cookie.herokuapp.com) -
Ruby on Rails group project showcasing an online commerce platform for a local cookie delivery service. The app facilitates online ordering and allows restaurant administrators to process and complete orders. Features: authentication, authorization, session-based shopping cart, and checkout. My main focus on this project was implementing the shopping cart, testing with Rspec, Capybara, and FactoryGirl, and implementing the front-end design and features with Bootstrap and JQuery. Contact me for login credentials to access the admin dashboard and functionality. And here is the [source code](https://github.com/teresafinn/the-dirty-cookie).

* [**Idea Box App**](http://teresa-idea-box.herokuapp.com/) -
First Ruby on Rails app built from scratch that allows an authenticated user to input ideas into an online platform, upload images, and categorize ideas. The project helped me learn the MVC framework, CRUD actions, RESTful routing, HTTP protocols, forms and route helpers, database modeling and relationships, flash messages, authentication with the cancancan gem, test-driven development, and robust testing of models and features with Rspec. Contact me for login credentials to access the admin dashboard and functionality. And here is the [source code](https://github.com/teresafinn/teresa-idea-box).

##  Crafty Projects
* **Growing Shitake Mushrooms** - The first thing I'm planning to do when I settle into my new DC-digs is to innoculate as many oak logs as I can get my hands on with shitake mushroom spawn. I am so excited for this process to begin! When I finally get back I'll be throwing a mushroom innoculation party where we'll drill holes into our logs, plug the holes with spawn, and seal them with wax so no foreign or competing molds can siphon resources from the shitake mycelia. Do you wanna come? Contact me! The mycelia will colonize the logs in 6-18 months (I'm hoping for 6 months) and then I can expect my flush of fresh shitake mushrooms. WIN!

* [**Logo and (simple) Digital Art Tinkering**](/projects/digital-art-tinkering) - I even developed (with templates) [Ascending Node](http://ascendingnode.ca/)'s live website!

* **Coffee Roasting** - My favorite coffee to both roast and drink is Ethiopian. It has a wonderfully fresh and delightful flavor when light-roasted!

* [**Cake Decorating**](/projects/cake-pictures) - Check out my [goodies gallery](/projects/cake-pictures)!
