## About Me

Check out my [**resume**]() for an overview of my current projects, education, and more.

I am a junior software developer that is idealling looking to work for a company that helps makes the world a better place. I'm passionate about user experience and enjoy developing all throughout the stack from the backend to the front. I'm interested in test-driven development and can't help but design from a user-centric perspective.

In addition to my technical abilities and interests, I have excellent communication skills. I am known for my aptitude to listen and adapt and work effectively with a wide range of people - technical and nontechnical alike. I'm detail-oriented, attentive to writing clean code, and very hungry to learn.

Community is very important to me so I try to participate as much as possible in my local tech meetups including Girl DevelopIT and Ruby Users Group. I help organize Ruby for Good, an annual hackathon-type event that takes place in Washington DC over a weekend to build apps for non-profit organizations; this year I'm looking forward to building something amazing for the Fairfax Humane Society. I have visions of organizing a meetup that brings together people from the nonprofit sector with people in the technology sector - I think bringing these two groups of people together has the potential to create incredible opportunities.

## What I'm Looking For

The three main things I am looking for:

* Meaningful work that ideally helps make the world a better place
* Good people and collaborative environment
* Remote friendly

######Location

Ideally I am looking for a company supports remote employees. While I'm happy to consider working in a specific location, my dream is to work remotely.

I am currently based in Denver, CO, but expect to relocate back to the Washington DC area in fall 2015.


######Culture/Pros

I'd love to work for a company culture that promotes:

* Collaboration — People actively work together and share knowledge to solve business problems. I would love to collaborate with people on and beyond the engineering team (QA, design, UX, support).
* Work/life balance — Sustainable work environment where people work about 40 hours/week
* 401k match
* Professional development — I'm very eager to learn new things and I want to soak up all opportunities possible, including attending conferences and would love to be supported in my request to do community outreach.
* Travel — I love to travel and would greatly appreciate the opportunity to travel to different cities and countries.
* Start Date — I'm looking to start ASAP! If it's for a position for which I'll need to relocate, I would love a month or two to take care of logistics.

## FAQ

*Why do you want to work remote?*

The tech community in DC is awesome and ideally I'd like to go back there. I've immensely enjoyed working with my mentors remotely. Perhaps it's because people who work remotely are forced to communicate effectively - not sure what it is but the remote interactions I've had have been fabulous.

*Why did you switch careers?*

Answer to come.
