## Skills and Abilities

Check out my [**resume**](/images/finn-resume.pdf) and [**github**](https://github.com/teresafinn) for an overview of my current projects, education, and more.

I am a junior software developer looking to work for an organization that helps make the world a better place. I'm passionate about user experience and enjoy developing all throughout the stack from the backend to the front. I'm interested in test-driven development and can't help but design from a user-centric perspective. I've worked primarily with Ruby and Rails but would be delighted to push the boundaries of my knowledge; I'm quick to learn new skills and technologies.

In addition to my technical abilities and interests, I have excellent communication skills. I'm known for my ability to listen, adapt, and work effectively with a wide range of people - technical and nontechnical alike. I'm detail-oriented, attentive to writing clean code, and very hungry to learn.

Community is very important to me so I try to participate as much as possible in my local tech meetups including Girl DevelopIT and the Ruby Users Group. I help organize Ruby for Good, an annual hackathon-type event that takes place in Washington DC over a weekend to build apps for non-profit organizations; this year I'm looking forward to building something amazing for the Fairfax Humane Society. I have visions of organizing a meetup that brings together people from the nonprofit sector with people in the technology sector - I think creating social connections between these two groups has the potential to create incredible opportunities for the world.

## What I'm Looking For
The three main things I am looking for:

* **Meaningful work** that ideally helps make the world a better place
* **Good people** and a collaborative environment that promotes learning
* **Remote friendly**

I'd love to work for a company culture that promotes:

* **Collaboration** — People actively work together and share knowledge to solve business problems. I consider it a bonus if I get to collaborate with people in all parts of the organization (design, UX, support, etc).
* **Work/life balance** — Sustainable work environment where people work about 40 hours/week.
* **Benefits** - Health insurance and 401k match would be incredible.
* **Professional development** — I'm very eager to learn new things and want to soak up all opportunities possible, including attending conferences. An added bonus if your organization invests in local community.
* **Travel** — I love to travel and would relish the opportunity to travel to different cities and countries. If you're looking for a traveler, I'm your woman!
* **Start Date** — Now! If the position requires relocation, I would love a month or two to take care of logistics.
* **Location** — I am looking for a company that supports remote employees. I am currently based in Denver, CO, but expect to relocate back to the Washington DC area in fall 2015 unless a better opportunity comes along! For non-remote positions, I would be happy to consider working in Portland, NYC, and Los Angeles.

## FAQ

**Why do you want to work remotely?**

<p class="tfindent"> I love the flexibility, freedom, and focus afforded by working remotely. Some day, I'd like to be able to live in different countries to learn local languages and cultures and maybe even help other people learn to program - all while working remotely! (Have you seen this interesting <strong><a href="http://animalnewyork.com/2014/artists-notebook-ramsey-nasser/">article</a></strong> about programming in Arabic? Wow.) I've immensely enjoyed working with my mentors from afar. We've been very successful with a combination of <strong><a href="https://screenhero.com/">Screenhero</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a></strong>. Perhaps it's because people who work on remote teams are extremely effective communicators, but the remote interactions I've had have been fabulous. I also have a wonderful walking desk that I use daily, and would love to continue using!</p>

**Why did you switch careers from higher education to tech?**

<p class="tfindent"> I want the skills to create tangible things that help make people's lives better and the most effective way to do that seemed, to me, to be technology. I've been interested in web development for quite some time but it's only in recent years that I've begun investing the time and energy to get good at it! I started by fiddling around with front end technologies and became increasingly interested in the backend. Attending DC Rails Girls in summer 2013 really motivated me to begin my backend journey. I'm still building my technical vocabulary and am ready and willing to learn all I can.</p>

**You did what now? What's this cake baking business...?**

<p class="tfindent"> I really love creating things. And also eating. Cake decorating is one way in which I can be creative, detail-oriented, eat tasty things, and have a lot of fun. I had a blast as a baker and still bake lots in my free time. Take a look at some of the <strong><a href="/hobbies">tasty treats</a></strong> I've made!</p>
