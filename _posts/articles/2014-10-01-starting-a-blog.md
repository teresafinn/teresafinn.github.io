# On Starting a Blog

Some things seem so intimidating when you first start coding. One of the many things I initially found intimidating was a starting a blog - I'm private! Why should I start one? Who would read it? What should I say? HOW do I do it exactly without spending oodles and oodles of resources finite time setting one up? I'll boil it down for you: use jekyll. There is a nice simple theme called So-Simple (shoutout to the person who developed it, it's beautiful!).
