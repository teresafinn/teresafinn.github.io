# Reviewing Git for Teams

The author was gracious enough to give me a review copy Git for Teams, something I was totally stoked by! For whatever reason, git and github were relatively opaque to me before reading this book. Not sure why… What follows is a chronicle of blogposts and resources that I’ve found useful. Possibly git/github didn’t make sense to me because I wasn’t initially working on a team? For personal projects, it seemed odd that I would commit changes. And then accessing those changes - whew! That seemed like a huge mess. Talk about the visualization tool you downloaded. For you visually-oriented programmers, the blah tool is really cool! Take a screenshot and paste it in your post.
