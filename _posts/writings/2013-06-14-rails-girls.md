### Thank you for your patience! I'm in the process of migrating my blog posts from a former location - full post to come soon!

<!-- So I've been taking a web design class at George Mason University that's offered through the College of Art and Design. It's been an amazing class, and has helped fast track my nascent Photoshop skills! I've become really very interested in the backend through this class and coding in general. We learn a lot about design principles and how to create sites that are visually pleasing. This is done primarily through Photoshop mockups. It's very fun. But it really makes me curious about how to actually design these sites and their interactive! Enter, Rails Girls.

This past weekend I went to RailsGirls in DC organized by [**Jam**](). I had a really good time. There were so many wonderful coaches there and because the ratio of coaches to RailsGirls was so good, I actually got my own personal coach [**Pete**](). He was amazingly helpful and really helped me understand the difference between HTML and Ruby. It's really inspired me to want to learn more about the backend of webdesign and how it interacts with front end design. I can't wait to discover more. :) -->
