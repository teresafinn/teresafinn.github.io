This past weekend I went to [**RailsGirls in DC**](http://railsgirls.com/dc) organized by [**Jam**](https://twitter.com/pplcallmejam). There were so many wonderful coaches there and because the ratio of coaches to RailsGirls was so good, I actually got my own personal coach [**Pete**](https://twitter.com/sumirolabs). He was amazingly helpful and really helped me understand the difference between HTML and Ruby - especially the whole idea of classes! Boy was that confusing. So. Mo' mo' mo' please! How do the back and front ends interact with each other? Must. Learn. More.
