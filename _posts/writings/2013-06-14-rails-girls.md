So this is it! The inception story, the creation myth of Teresa the Programmer. It began in my early years with my dad carting home a badass Mac computer and [**Carmen San Diego**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_in_the_World_Is_Carmen_Sandiego%3F). I had no idea how the game was programmed, but I sure was addicted to figuring out where theiving Carmen was hiding. How were her hiding places determined? How were graphics able to be shown on my computer?! Not quite sure how to find answers, I let these questions percolate. Fast forward to high school: I started volunteering in the basement of my high school tech department. Just because. It was here that I was introduced to the command line, linux, and [**MUDS**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD), text-based online role playing games where you fight monsters and solve quests. ([**3Kingdoms**](http://3k.org/) is still going strong, cheers to you!) With so many guilds to explore, monsters to defeat, and puzzles to solve, I got into making my playing more efficient - setting up triggers using conditional logic, "coding" my main stomping ground (which just meant describing the rooms), etc. Unbeknownst to me, I was slowly being introduced to basic programming concepts. I was so into this that I would insist my giant monitor, keyboard, and CPU be hucked into the trunk every weekend between trips to my parents' houses - I was dedicated, let me tell ya. For some reason it never occured to me that computers could be a career. College came along, and amidst distractions galore, I pretty much let my interest in computers lie dormant, waiting to be rediscovered years later.

I rediscovered my interest with front-end design. t started with an interest in the front-end


 I've been interested in digital art for quite some time and, taking advantage of my tuition benefits as an employee of a university, I decided to pursue the interest by taking a [**web design class**](http://catalog.gmu.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=19&coid=209378) offered through GMU's School of Art. It's been an amazing class, and has helped fast-track my growing Photoshop skills! I've become really very interested in the backend through this class and coding in general. We learn a lot about design principles and how to create sites that are visually pleasing. This is done primarily through Photoshop mockups. It's very fun. But it really makes me curious about how to actually design these sites and their interactive! Enter, Rails Girls.

This past weekend I went to [**RailsGirls in DC**](http://railsgirls.com/dc) organized by [**Jam**](https://twitter.com/pplcallmejam). I had a really good time. There were so many wonderful coaches there and because the ratio of coaches to RailsGirls was so good, I actually got my own personal coach [**Pete**](). He was amazingly helpful and really helped me understand the difference between HTML and Ruby. It's really inspired me to want to learn more about the backend of webdesign and how it interacts with front end design. I can't wait to discover more. :)
