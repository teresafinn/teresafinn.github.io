<!-- This and self -->

I come at Javascript with a Ruby background. Not having programmed in any other languages, I can't help but compare the two! Here are some initial observations, things I find quirky, or things that are just plain interesting:

- In Javascript syntax, there is no 'end' to if statements. In Ruby there is most definitely an 'end'. Unfortunately I seem to find the javascript more forgettable - I keep forgetting those semicolons!! Ex:

Javascript:

{% highlight javascript %}
if (alert) {
  print 1;
} else {
  print 2;
};
{% endhighlight %}

Ruby:

{% highlight ruby %}
if alert == true
  print 1
else
  print 2
end
{% endhighlight %}

- Javascript makes global and local variables a little more transparent than Ruby. In Javascript you have to declare variables (e.g.: `var x = 8`). If you don’t declare a variable inside of a function (`x = a + b`) then you will be resetting the variable x you had declared earlier to the evaluation of a + b. I think this is a bit more transparent than it is in Ruby. In Ruby you just have to KNOW that x = 8 in one context and x = something else in another context. The `var` declaration in Javascript makes this concept more explicit - nothing is hiding if you know the rule!

- Javascript calls functions; Ruby calls methods.

- Javascript has `this` while Ruby has `self`. As far as I can tell, they both are indicative of the same concept - they both refer to the object in which they're being called. That object could be a function/method or referring to the class to which the object belongs. Objects in Javascript are still a bit confusing to me. I'm not sure what the Javascript equivalent of a Ruby class is yet, more pondering to come on that as I get further along.

- Declared functions versus function expressions. This is where Javascript and Ruby begin to feel really different to me. A declared function explicitly gives the function a name. A function expression assigns a function (either named or unnamed) to a variable. Functions take parameters and can be passed around. I'm still working through this, but the way functions are working somehow feels different to me than it does in Ruby...

These are initial observations and the more I work with Javascript, the more I'll add!
