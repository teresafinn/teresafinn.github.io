### Thank you for your patience! I'm in the process of migrating my blog posts from a former location - full post to come soon!

<!-- This is some pretty interesting stuff right here! I love the idea of exploring this!! -->

<!-- This and self

In JS syntax, there are no “end” to if statements. The syntax is different (and forgettable unfortunately. if (thing) { ;} else { ;}

confirm, prompt, alert

javascript makes global and local variables a little more transparent than ruby. In javascript you have to declare variables (e.g.: var x = 8). If you don’t declare a variable inside of a function (x = a + b) then you will be resetting the variable x you had declared earlier to the evaluation of a + b. I think this is a bit more transparent than it is in ruby. In Ruby you just have to KNOW that x = 8 in one context and x = something else in another context. tricky, tricky!

declared function versus function expression.
a declared function explicitly gives the function a name. a function expression assigns a function (either named or unnamed) to a variable. -->
