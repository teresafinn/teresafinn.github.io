I am reading a memoir and one of the lines reminded me of something we were talking about.

I told you I admire men physically. And that it's intense and visceral. I told you that my sentiment seems to... run against the tide of popular culture. I've read and heard numerous things indicating that a man's body isn't as beautiful as a woman's—from both men and women. When I mentioned this, you didnt really demonstrate that you understood. You asked me to explain. You wanted more details.

It is (and was) difficult to marshall proof of a perception that builds slowly with time and experience; cultural sentiment is ephemeral and ever-changing. It is (and was) difficult to exactly pinpoint why my view seems to stand at contradistinction to what seems an intangible yet very pervasive "feeling" that men's bodies are not... as beautiful, as revered, as pleasing.

I never read memoirs. But this one interested me: [**Hold Still**](http://www.amazon.com/Hold-Still-A-Memoir-Photographs/dp/0316247766) by Sally Mann. She's a controversial photographer who was crucified in the early 90's for publishing nude pictures of her children.

Reflecting on photographs she's taken of her husband, she writes:

>"While working on these pictures, I joined the thinly populated group of women who have looked unflinchingly at men, and who frequently have been punished for doing so... I can think of numerous male artists, from Bonnard to Weston to Stieglitz, who have photographed their lovers and spouses, but I am having trouble finding parallel examples among my sister photographers. The act of looking appraisingly at a man, studying his body and asking to photograph him, is a brazen venture for a woman; for a male photographer, these acts are commonplace, even expected."

I wonder, is that proof enough? Shall I contradict myself with reference to Michelangelo's David? "A different time and culture, a different mythology, a different politics," I argue. So are men's bodies as admired, as glorified, as sexualized, as women's? Is my premise sound?

I'm not sure one can definitively "prove" a cultural thread. And to the extent one can, how rigid to impose such structure on human fluidity. Would that I could generate on demand reference to a fabulously learned person renouncing a positive ontology when considering culture.
