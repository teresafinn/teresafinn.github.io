[**The Name of the Wind**](http://www.amazon.com/Name-Wind-Kingkiller-Chronicle/dp/0756404746/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1437298364&sr=1-1&keywords=name+of+the+wind&pebp=1437298365619&perid=10FJZ4KEYJAPT3MYGPQR), Patrick Rothfuss


As far as I'm concerned, this was everything that Lord of the Rings was not - well-written, engaging, delightful dialogue, gifted narration... I know, I know, the Lord of the Rings trilogy captured your imagination as well as the imaginations of youths everywhere. But (because of course there's a but)... reading it for the first time as an adult left me so *disappointed*. The movies are infinitely better than the books. Infinitely. No exaggeration! Anyway, on to The Name of the Wind...

Kvothe is a legend. Stories are written about him. Bards sing songs about him. But who is he really? Kvothe has hidden himself away from the world in a small backwater town disguising himself as an inkeeper. Perchance, a chronicler comes across his path and recognizes him beneath his humble garb as Kvothe. Kvothe begins to tell his story - "from his childhood in a troupe of traveling players, to years spent as a near-feral orphan in a crime-riddled city, to his daringly brazen yet successful bid to enter a difficult and dangerous school of magic." We find that he's an accomplished musician and performer, brilliant student, and gifted magician. The book, quite simply, tells the story of Kvothe.

Rothfuss is a masterful storyteller - the book has an amazingly perfect cadence. It is chalk-full of adventure and excitement, but takes interludes between action to set a wonderful speed that kept this reader completely and totally engaged. The first book is some 800 pages but I flew through it because the world Rothfuss creates is so beautifully woven together. Not only is it perfectly paced, but it's perfectly written with depth! Often in fantasty books, I get distracted by language or grammar, or perhaps the story and conflicts are shallow. This book is well-crafted; there are no distracting grammatical errors or clumsy phraseology and conflict is balanced between internal and external struggles. I think more than anything else, the balance of all elements of the book allowed this reader to completely sink into Rothfusses world and enjoy the story unfolding. The extremely well-thought-out world with backstories to the story arcs, and backstories to each of the characters, is engaging.

Kvothe as a character is interesting; he is an underdog, but brilliant at most everything he attempts. This makes him arrogant - sometimes charmingly so, sometimes not. Kvothe's character becomes real through his flaws. Sometimes you cry for him and sometimes you wanna whack him upside the head. But always he is interesting (excepting maybe with Denna, where they both act like nincompoops).

I've also managed to speed through the second book of the trilogy, *The Wise Man's Fear*. At a whopping 1100 pages, you would think this would be difficult, but the story is, once again, compelling! While the second book is also engaging, it takes a bit longer than initially expected to move the plot forward.

*The Wise Man's Fear* continues for the first few hundred pages much the same as the first book - Kvothe is still at the university studying magic, in a similar poverty-stricken condition, with the same friends, visiting the neighboring city to play music, and mostly living the same pattern of life. In fact, the beginning of *The Wise Man's Fear* is so similar to *The Name of the Wind* that I rather wonder why Rothfuss simply didn't lengthen the first book a bit in order to break the books on plot.

As the book progresses the plot shifts and widens to encorporate Kvothe's experiences in different parts of the world, with diverse cultures, and complex social politics. There are some fun ideas in here - like a people who don't communicate with facial expressions but only in hand-gestures. Or a cloak woven literally from shadow and moonlight. Or a Naming teacher who knows much more than he lets on.

Overall, I loved both books. It bears mentioning that I am particularly delighted by the literary framing device Rothfuss uses to initiate the stories - the prologue reads kind of... ritualistic, a recitation of a familiar and well-loved story that you relish hearing again and again.

The third book, *The Doors of Stone* comes out sometime next year. I am eagerly waiting. The series is perfect for readers with a penchant for stories full of fantasy, adventure, and magic!
