[**The Name of the Wind**](http://www.amazon.com/Name-Wind-Kingkiller-Chronicle/dp/0756404746/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1437298364&sr=1-1&keywords=name+of+the+wind&pebp=1437298365619&perid=10FJZ4KEYJAPT3MYGPQR), Patrick Rothfuss


As far as I'm concerned, this was everything that Lord of the Rings was not - well-written, engaging, delightful dialogue, gifted narration... I know, I know, the Lord of the Rings trilogy captured your imagination as well as the imaginations of youths everywhere. But (because of course there's a but)... reading it for the first time as an adult left me so *disappointed*. The movies are infinitely better than the books. Infinitely. No exaggeration! Anyway, The Name of the Wind...

Kvothe is a legend. Stories are written about him. Bards sing songs about him. But who is he really? Kvothe has hidden himself away from the world in a small backwater town disguising himself as an inkeeper. Perchance, a chronicler comes across his path and recognizes him beneath his humble garb as Kvothe. Kvothe begins to tell his story - "from his childhood in a troupe of traveling players, to years spent as a near-feral orphan in a crime-riddled city, to his daringly brazen yet successful bid to enter a difficult and dangerous school of magic." We find that he's an accomplished musician and performer, brilliant student, and gifted magician. The book quite simply tells the story of Kvothe.

Rothfuss is a masterful storyteller - the book has quite an amazingly perfect cadence. It is chalk-full of adventure and excitement, but takes interludes between action to set a wonderful speed that kept this reader completely and totally engaged. The book is some 800 pages but I flew through it because it was so well done! Not only is it perfectly paced, but it's perfectly written! Often in fantasty books, I get distracted by language or grammar. This book is so well done that there were no distractions to be found. It allowed this reader to completely sink into the world of the book and enjoy the story unfolding.

In short, I highly recommend this book to anyone with a penchant for stories full of fantasy, adventure, and magic!
