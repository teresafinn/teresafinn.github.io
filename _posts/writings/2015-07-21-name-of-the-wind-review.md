[**The Name of the Wind**](http://www.amazon.com/Name-Wind-Kingkiller-Chronicle/dp/0756404746/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1437298364&sr=1-1&keywords=name+of+the+wind&pebp=1437298365619&perid=10FJZ4KEYJAPT3MYGPQR), Patrick Rothfuss


Brace yourself. I am about to say something offensive.

*The Name of the Wind* was infinitely better than *Lord of the Rings* (book version - movie version still wins at everything). In fact, *The Name of the Wind* was everything I had expected *Lord of the Rings* to be before I attempted to read the books. Yes, attempted. It was well-written, interesting, balanced, engaging. It had delightful dialogue, gifted narration, compelling internal and external conflict... I am content to sing its praises all the day. I'll bet you're wondering what it's about. Let me tell you!

Kvothe is a legend. Stories are written about him. Bards sing songs about him. But who is he really? Kvothe has hidden himself away from the world in a small backwater disguising himself as an inkeeper. Perchance, a chronicler comes across his path and recognizes him beneath his humble garb as Kvothe. Kvothe begins to tell his story - "from his childhood in a troupe of traveling players, to years spent as a near-feral orphan in a crime-riddled city, to his daringly brazen yet successful bid to enter a difficult and dangerous school of magic." We find that he's an accomplished musician and performer, brilliant student, tenacious survivor, and gifted magician.

Kvothe as a character is interesting; he is an underdog, but brilliant at most everything he attempts. Natural brilliance and aptitude make him arrogant - sometimes charmingly so (sometimes not). He's brazen enough to attempt winning an importance musician's token while having never performed in public, but is over zealous in his dealings with a spoiled school bully. You alternately hurt for him and want to smack him (his behavior with lady-friend Denna is a case in point).

Rothfuss is a masterful storyteller - the book is superbly crafted with an amazingly perfect cadence. It is chock-full of adventure and excitement, but takes interludes between action to explore internal conflict. It remains engaging through all 800-some pages. There are no distracting grammatical errors or clumsy phraseology, as is often the case with fantasy. The balance of all elements allow for total immersion into Rothfuss's world and the unfolding story. There's real depth to the characters and the world they inhabit. I only speculate how many unpublished backstory tales Rothfuss has written to achieve such depth and consistency.

I've managed to speed through the second book of the trilogy, *The Wise Man's Fear*, as well. At a whopping 1100 pages, you would think this would be difficult, but the story is - once again - compelling! It takes Rothfuss a bit longer to move the plot forward than initially expected, though. *The Wise Man's Fear* continues for the first few hundred pages much the same as the first book - Kvothe is still at the university studying magic, in a similar poverty-stricken condition, with the same friends, visiting a neighboring city to play music, and mostly living the same pattern of life. In fact, the beginning of *The Wise Man's Fear* is so similar to *The Name of the Wind* that I rather wonder why Rothfuss simply didn't lengthen the first book a bit in order to break the books on plot.

As *The Wise Man's Fear* progresses the plot shifts and widens to encorporate Kvothe's experiences in different parts of the world, with diverse cultures, and complex social politics. There are some fun ideas in here - a people who don't communicate with facial expressions but only in hand-gestures. Or a cloak woven literally from shadow and moonlight. Or a rather mysterious Naming teacher who knows much more than he lets on.

Overall, I loved both books. It bears mentioning that I am particularly delighted by the literary framing device Rothfuss uses to initiate the stories - the prologue reads kind of... ritualistic, a recitation of a familiar and well-loved story that you relish hearing again and again: "It was the patient, cut-flower sound of a man who is waiting to die."

The third book, *The Doors of Stone* comes out sometime next year. I am eagerly waiting. The series is perfect for readers with a penchant for stories full of fantasy, adventure, and magic!
