>"Once a thing is known it can never be unknown. It can only be forgotten. And, in a way that bends time, so long as it is remembered, it will indicate the future. It is wiser, in every circumstance, to forget, to cultivate the art of forgetting. To remember is to face the enemy. The truth lies in remembering." â€” [Look at Me](https://www.amazon.com/Look-at-Me-Anita-Brookner/dp/0679738134)

In a way, I think remembering distasteful, immoral. Why hold my present hostage to my past, limiting what can be newly experienced? Do I need to know my former self, insofar as it's distinct from my present self? Why?

The truth lies in remembering, she says. The sentence is wonderful in its double entendre! The truth, she suggests, that capital T behemoth that cannot be argued with or interpreted, this is what rests in remembering. And in resting there, it lies, it apes that behemoth capital T Truth. It pretends to be static, unarguable. Remembering unmutable truths, using them, removes individual agency to reflect, reevaluate, reinterpret. And isn't that what being human is all about?

To remember is to face the enemy, she says. Is the enemy Truth?
