### Thank you for your patience! I'm in the process of migrating my blog posts from a former location - full post to come soon!


<!-- You can do some pretty amazing things with technology and be exposed to some fantastic opportunities. I currently work at George Mason University and was recently instroduced to [**Professor Lisa Kahn**](http://analytics.gmu.edu/profile/lisa-kahn/) who has been involved for the past 15 years on an [**archaeological project**](http://www.pompeii-food-and-drink.org/) researching the ruins of Pompeii. She is looking for a person with database and website skills to bring the project online. Right now they store all their email in an excel file and email back and forth this spreadsheet to collect their data. In exchange you get to come on this amazing trip to Pompeii, participate in primary research, and contribute to a very worthy project! My skills arent yet up to par but possibly next year? After researching and talking to Lisa, I'm totally in. This year I'll get a sense of what the project needs and then next time I can actually help on building out a custom tool for the researchers to store and easily access all the great information they've collected over the past 15 years! AMAZING! For anyone thinking about possibly making the plunge into a technological career, if this doesn't lure you in, I don't know what will! ;) -->
