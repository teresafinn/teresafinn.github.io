I help to organize a conference called Ruby for Good, a community-based service event, to help build non-profit organizations custom software or web applications that they might not otherwise be able to afford. This year it will take place at George Mason University from July 31-August 2nd. I am SUPER excited about it. I've spoken to so many non-profits to get project ideas. We've narrowed it down to the Humane Society of Fairfax, the Denver GrowHaus, the World Wildlife Fund, the Purple Door, All Income Foods, Baltimore Arts, the US Vote Foundation, and the RSpec-Rails team. Some fantastic projects in the line up this year.

One of the reasons I'm so excited about Ruby for Good this year is because it will afford me an entry point into open source. Nearly all my mentors, both formal and in-passing, have advised me to contribute to open source - a resume builder, an opportunity to use new skills. Okay. But it's intimidating. Where to start? How to find projects? How to avoid an amateurish face plant?

I'd been trying to figure out where to start when I was afforded an opportunity to help with Ruby for Good. With tons of project management and administrative experience under the belt, why not. So I jumped on in...

Participating in an event like Ruby for Good, especially if you're new and don't know where to begin, helps usher you into the world of open source in a friendly, non-threatening way. People are around to help you, you're part of a team, and you can choose a cause that you believe in so all the time you spend working on a project, you're actually working toward the greater good.

For me this year it will likely be working on a project for the GrowHaus - I love plants and I really want to eventually build sensors to track how my plants are doing. Ideally I want this integrated into an automated watering system that's mounted, picture style, on the wall. I call this a living wall to myself, but I suppose it's more like a living picture...
