I am helping to organize a conference called Ruby for Good, a hackathon type event to help build non-profits custom software or web applications that they might not otherwise be able to afford. This year it will take place at George Mason University from July 31-August 2nd. I am SUPER excited about this upcoming event. We've spoken to so many non-profits and finally narrowed it down to the Humane Society of Fairfax, the Denver GrowHaus, the World Wildlife Fund, the Purple Door, All Income Foods, Baltimore Arts, the US Vote Foundation, and the RSpec-Rails team. The projects really seem AMAZING and I can't wait to get to work.

One of the reasons I'm so excited about Ruby for Good this year is because it will afford me an entry point into open source! Let’s face it: Contributing to open source is intimidating!

<!-- I also want it to be reflective of my interests because it’s my free time I’m spending contributing so I definitely want to enjoy myself! -->
