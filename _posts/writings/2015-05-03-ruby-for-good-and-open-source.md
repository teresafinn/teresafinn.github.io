### Thank you for your patience! I'm in the process of migrating my blog posts from a former location - full post to come soon!

I am helping to organize a conference called Ruby for Good, a community-based service event, to help build non-profit organizations custom software or web applications that they might not otherwise be able to afford. This year it will take place at George Mason University from July 31-August 2nd. I am SUPER excited about it. I've spoken to so many non-profits to get project ideas and channel our energies to where they're really needed. Finally  we have it narrowed down to the Humane Society of Fairfax, the Denver GrowHaus, the World Wildlife Fund, the Purple Door, All Income Foods, Baltimore Arts, the US Vote Foundation, and the RSpec-Rails team. The projects really seem AMAZING and I can't wait for the weekend to get here!!

One of the reasons I'm so excited about Ruby for Good this year is because it will afford me an entry point into open source! Nearly all my mentors, both formal and in-passing mentors, have advised me that I need to be contributing to open source in order to use my new-found skills. But contributing to open source seems intimidating! Where do you start? How do you find a project? How can you be effective when you're a new-comer to an established project, not to mention being relatively new to programming in general?! I find these waters difficult to navigate.

I'd been trying to figure out where to start when I was afforded an opportunity to help organize Ruby for Good. I've got tons of project management and administrative experience so I figured why not put that to good use doing something I believe in?! So I jumped at the opportunity! In doing so, I've been slowly learning that getting involved in open source is not as difficult as one may think...

First, I've decided that doing an event like Ruby for Good, especially if you're new and don't know where to begin, can really help usher you into the world of open source in a friendly, non-threatening way. People are around to help you, you're part of a team, and you can choose a cause that you believe in so all the time you spend working on a project, you're actually working toward something you're passionate about at the same time.

For me this year it will likely be working on a project for the GrowHaus - I love plants and I really want to eventually build sensors to track how my plants are doing. Ideally I want this integrated into an automated watering system that's mounted, picture style, on my wall. I call this a living wall to myself, but I suppose it's more like a living picture. (Start with the picture frame sized plant wall and work up to a full-sized wall, right?!)

I'm super stoked to be part of this great project and encourage you to take a look around at your local community events to see if there's anything similar. And then jump right in! Open source doesn't have to be intimidating. :)
