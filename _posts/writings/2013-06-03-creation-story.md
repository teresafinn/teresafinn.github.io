So this is it! The inception story, the creation myth of Teresa the Programmer. It began in my early years with my dad carting home a Mac computer and [**Carmen San Diego**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_in_the_World_Is_Carmen_Sandiego%3F). I had no idea how the game was programmed, but I sure was addicted to figuring out where theiving Carmen was hiding. How were her hiding places determined? How were graphics able to be shown on my computer?! Not quite sure how to find answers, I let these questions percolate. Fast forward to high school: I started volunteering in the basement of my high school tech department. Just because. It was here that I was introduced to the command line, linux, and [**MUDS**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD), text-based online role playing games where you fight monsters and solve quests. ([**3Kingdoms**](http://3k.org/) is still going strong, cheers to you!) With so many guilds to explore, monsters to defeat, and puzzles to solve, I got into making my playing more efficient - setting up triggers using conditional logic, "coding" my main stomping ground (which just meant describing the rooms), etc. Unbeknownst to me, I was slowly being introduced to basic programming concepts. I was so into this that I would insist my giant 1990's monitor, keyboard, and CPU be hucked into the trunk every weekend between trips to my parents' houses - I was dedicated, let me tell ya. For some reason it never occured to me that computers could be a career. College came along, and amidst distractions galore, I pretty much let my interest in computers lie dormant, waiting to be rediscovered years later.

And now here we are, years later. Believe it or not, my interest in the back-end has started with the front-end. I began with front-endy things - tinkering with Photoshop to create logos, fiddling with picture editing, making icons. Having done a few fun things for friends and family, I decided to build myself a website. I read up on HTML and CSS and jumped right in. You can imagine how [**that**](http://www.lingscars.com/) went... Given my apparent lack of design sense and dearth of knowledge surrounding how to actually set up a functioning and attractive site, I recently decided to take a [**web design class**](http://catalog.gmu.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=19&coid=209378) offered through GMU's School of Art - I work at the university afterall, might as well advantage of those tuition benefits!!

So far it's been an amazing class, and has helped fast-track my growing Photoshop skills. I'm a few weeks in and learning a ton about design principles: how to create mock-ups by hand, how to reason my way through design decisions, how to create sites that are visually pleasing and intuitive (as a side note, user experience sounds really, really cool and is something I'll be reading more about!). Super fun. I've realized that a lot of my visualizations have to do with users interacting with the site. I didn't even have that vocabulary before this class! We won't be covering JavaScript, but I sure see the need to take a look I can fully implement the fun things I envision. So much to learn. I've been reading tons of blog posts about the front-end versus the back-end and what that distinction actually means. It makes me REALLY curious to explore what the back-end is about! So I've decided to start this blog to track my technical development and share insights into my learning process. Cheers and happy reading!
