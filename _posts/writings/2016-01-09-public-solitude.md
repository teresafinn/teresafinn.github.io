>"Method actors like to talk about something called “public solitude” — that is, the ability to seem alone onstage. Really, to be alone, without wondering how you look to the audience. They will tell you this is the basis of naturalistic acting: to forget about the audience. Only then can you build a character, pay attention to others onstage and act out a scene.

>"To write a story also requires public solitude. You can’t be worrying how you sound. You can’t wonder whether you or your characters are likable or smart or interesting. You have to be inside the scene — the tactile world of tables and chairs and sunlight — attending to your characters, people who exist for you in nonvirtual reality. This takes weird brain chemistry. (A surprising number of novelists hear voice, and not metaphorically. They hear voice in their heads.) It also takes years of reading — solitary reading."
— Excerpt from "[**Words Unwired**](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/10/books/review/words-unwired.html?smid=tw-nytbooks&smtyp=cur)," By Lorin Stein in NYT Jan. 8, 2016.

Public solitude. Hmm.

In striving to develop an authentic voice, one that reflects the vagaries of my thought and utter delight in ideas rather than manufacturing immutable conclusions... this is tough! To let go consciousness of others' perceptions? Impossible. Intriguing.

Public solitude. Or perhaps just "solitude," nothing public about it. Maybe the "public" comes after the solitude so there's no interference in being fully present, wholely authentic. What of it if I explore an idea, no tangible conclusion on which to cleave.

When writing, do you not frantically consider: who is the audience, how to shape their perception, what do I want them to see? Of course appropriate in some cases, no doubt - a school assignment, a letter to the boss. But in fiction? In essay? How infinitely fun to be free of self-conscious awareness of reader perception! "...let us read the word “I” and feel that it’s not attached to a product."

I suppose the challenge is to write clearly, given one is so familiar with one's own thoughts. Clearly, logically, but adhering to the reality living "inside the scene." How can you be accountable to two audiences, afterall? The one taking precedence should be the one in your head. Eager to try this!
