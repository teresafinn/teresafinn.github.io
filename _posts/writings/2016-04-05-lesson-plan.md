School: to learn or to earn? This has so many implications for the way we educate. Trade school v. liberal arts education. Ability/interest in critical thinking v. producing something tangible. Not mutually exclusive, of course, but each lends itself to an educational system. Shall we prioritize broad learning or a bigger paycheck?

Discussing individual return on investment in education, Bowen and McPherson write:
>"We also embrace the truth that the benefits of education extend well beyond those of a bigger paycheck or even a financially better-off society. Few Americans, however, have the luxury of divorcing their plans for education from their concerns for a secure livelihood or for a more prosperous society." â€” [Lesson Plan: An Agenda for Change in American Higher Education](http://www.amazon.com/Lesson-Plan-Agenda-American-Education-ebook/dp/B018T6DEZ4)

Touche, Bowen and McPherson. Well said. And so it was that reflection on the learn/earn debate becomes frivolous. Maybe even irresponsible.

My sister asks my blessing on borrowing $260k to author and edit dreams. My options: dream-crusher; liar. The conversation is meaningless to her - paychecks? learning? She wants to be a writer, an editor. What of her, divorcing her education plans from both livelihood and learning. What about the dreams.
