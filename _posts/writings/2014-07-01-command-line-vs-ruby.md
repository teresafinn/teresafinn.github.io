<!-- Video for Newbies: The difference between the command line and Ruby.
If you’re anything like me, when you started you had no idea what the command line was, why it was useful, or how come people kept stealing your computer to interact with the command line, presumably putting things on your computer that you’d need to begin coding. Initially these things are totally opaque to a beginner!! This video explains the difference between command line tools, and tools/commands that are specific to Ruby. The first thing to understand is… Ruby is an interpreted language. This means you can type ‘ruby’ into your shell. What is the shell? -->
