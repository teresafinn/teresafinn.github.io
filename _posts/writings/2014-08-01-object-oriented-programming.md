### Thank you for you patience! I'm in the process of migrating my blog posts from a former location - full post to come soon!

<!-- For a newbie to programming that doesn’t have a background in computer science and is really very new to the programming world, understanding object orientation is a challenge! You have nothing to juxtapose this against, as it’s largely a theoretical construct and since you have no experience with other languages, the fact that something is object-oriented really takes a while to digest. Arguably, I don’t think I really understood it until I read David Black’s book the Well-Grounded Rubyist.
