Review of [Lady Chatterley’s Lover](http://www.amazon.com/Lady-Chatterleys-Lover-D-H-Lawrence/dp/193425519X) (in process)

As I read, it sometimes has an Ayn Randian-feel to it; Lawrence preaches his politico-moral views of the world: industry is evil, the mind is our downfall. (As in, being hyper rational so as to not allow elemental sensation, so as to negate what it means to be human, is wrong.)

<!-- speaking of which, isn’t this an interesting juxtaposition? Isn’t there simply the world of the mind versus the world of industry? Aren’t you on one side or the other? Aren’t you Ayn Rand or not? Lawrence seems to problematize this modern dichotomy by condemning both the world of the mind and the world of industry. So what, then, does he want?)
 -->
I like this book quite a lot. But not due to an abstract, distant set of scholarly criteria. I like it because it touches me, it deals with issues I’m sensitive about - the role of women, the blackness brought on by the industrial revolution and the advent of modern capitalism, the relationship between sex and love, the profound aloneness of the characters - these are themes that resonate.

<!-- The book resonates but I can see how it wouldn’t resonate with everyone. -->

It’s a shame that the sex is such a distraction, that it features so prominently in writers' blurbs about the book. The themes are so much more than simply sex.

The way Lawrence portrays women - I am very ambivalent about this. Some scenes are disconcerting to a modern reader and it’s difficult for me to turn that perspective off. What was status quo in the 20s... what of the defeatist sex in the woods, the discussion of female genitalia?

Lawrence portrays the intenseness of the character’s feelings very well, I rather revel in that emotional intensity - the repulsion with which Connie receives her husband’s needy, insecure devotion; the utter insanity felt by Connie as she withers away, lifeless; the resentment of nothingness, of meaningless words and events. Perhaps conditioned by my early love of Jane Eyre?

The language is lyrical and repetitive. But Lawrence’s writing is periodically bogged down by details. Is Lawrence a good storyteller? A good writer?

In a [piece](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/24/magazine/judy-blume-knows-all-your-secrets.html) about her upcoming novel written for adults, Judy Blume writes “I’m a storyteller — you know what I mean — an inventor of people... and their relationships. It’s not that I love the words — that’s not the kind of writer I am. So I’m not a great writer. But maybe I’m a really good storyteller.”

Is Lawrence a good storyteller? A good writer? (In retrospect, I can't help remember the ever-amazing James Parker's [writing](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/21/books/review/where-do-you-draw-the-line-between-commercial-and-literary-fiction.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Fbookends&action=click&contentCollection=review&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=4&pgtype=collection&_r=0) on commercial v. literary fiction. God I love James Parker.) I don’t know that he’s either. I really wonder why he’s considered one of the greatest novelists of the 20th century... is he really? By what standard? I could definitely see this novel being derided as a penny novel, a cheap romance. I’m not sure why, or how, it’s great literature. I love the themes but they are somewhat clumsily presented (as with Ayn Rand who creates puppet characters spouting 100+ pages of her political philosophy) (why do I keep thinking of Ayn Rand).

Certainly as a reader, I am attentive to the words. Indeed I love the words. I love the ideas. Storytelling is important, I suppose, but if the story isn’t so interesting, then let the language carry me through. Is it so with all readers? How to understand my complete and utter indifference to Like Water for Elephants, a book much acclaimed. Or my disgust for the Culture Series books, again highly acclaimed. Or, dare I admit it, my utter boredom with Hemmingway’s Old Man and the Sea (and others).

Maybe the fact that I’m inspired to write anything at all is testimony to the fact that he is a great writer. I’ll solidify my thoughts, and read more. I do like him/this book much more than most books/authors. :)
