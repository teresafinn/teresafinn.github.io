### Thank you for your patience! I'm in the process of migrating my blog posts from a former location - full post to come soon!

<!-- Alright so reading a new gem is completely terrifying and exciting. When I first started, I had no idea what I was doing. My irregularly meeting coding club had a Saturday session led by Josh Cheek that tackled this exact topic. None of us had ever explored Carrier Wave so we decided to try going over the source code and playing around. A number of cool realizations came up during this discovery but I decided to take it further and look into it more. I want to share my process with you so you too might be able to explore gems terror-free! Itâ€™s really not bad, I promise!! -->
