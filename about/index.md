# Allow me to introduce myself...
I'm Teresa and I love creating! My current long-lived obsession is creating with technology. From crafting backend website functionality, to exploring all the incredible interactivity of Javascript, to fiddling with D3 and other data visualization tools - I love technology and all the wonderful things one can do with it to make the world a better, and more beautiful, place.

I find the modern web development stack fascinating and love learning how the many pieces fit together. The puzzles represented by systems - technological systems, organizational systems, sociological systems - are endlessly engaging. I love mapping out how things work together to create a unified whole, which maybe explains my background in philosophy, cake decorating, political science, and plants - all systems oriented interests!

I love challenges, people, and figuring out the whys. I have wide ranging interests and experiences - I've worked as a currency trader, English teacher in China, international trade analyst, cake decorator, higher ed administrator, fledgling academic, barista, and more. Particularly delightful topics for me: digital journalism and the changes to news delivery, enagaging communities through technology, the intersection of liberal arts and technology, front-end development, and the differences between computer languages. I am a huge believer in the power and importance of communities - I help organize [**Ruby for Good**](http://rubyforgood.com) and designed this beautiful [**logo**](/images/ruby-for-good-logo.jpg) for our annual meeting.

In my free time I'm often focused on my master plan to populate all apartments (especially mine) with automated living plant walls. I'm an avid gardener and try to colonize all viable spaces with plants. I am also frequently decorating delicious and [**tasty treats**](/hobbies). I dig roasting my own coffee, reading, and am loving learning how to be a better cyclist. Very soon I will start growing my own shitake mushrooms, mmMmMmm!
