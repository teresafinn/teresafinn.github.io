# Allow me to introduce myself...
I'm Teresa and I love creating! My current obsession and chosen career is creating with technology. From crafting backend website functionality, to exploring all the incredible interactivity of Javascript, to fiddling with D3 and other data visualization tools - I love technology and all the wonderful things one can do with it to make the world a better, and more beautiful, place.

I find the modern web development stack fascinating and love learning how the many pieces fit together. The puzzles represented by systems - technological systems, organizational systems, sociological systems - are endlessly engaging. I love mapping out how things work together to create a unified whole, which maybe explains my background in philosophy, cake decorating, political science, and plants - all systems oriented interests!

Enagaging communities through technology, software testing, front-end development, and the differences between computer languages, are all particularly delightful topics. I am a huge believer in the power and importance of communities - I help organize [**Ruby for Good**](http://rubyforgood.com) and designed this beautiful [**logo**](/images/ruby-for-good-logo.jpg) for our annual hackathon.

In my free time I'm often focused on my master plan to populate all apartments (especially mine) with automated living plant walls. I am also frequently decorating delicious and [**beautiful baked goods**](instagram?).
